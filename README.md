### 💡 Importance of Identifying Design Properties in a Mockup
Defining **color styles, typography, and layout guidelines** early in the design process is essential because it ensures:  
- **Consistency**: All developers and designers follow the same visual rules.  
- **Scalability**: Makes it easier to add new features without breaking the design.  
- **Efficiency**: Saves time during development since design tokens (colors, fonts) are predefined.  
- **User Experience**: A consistent look and feel helps users navigate easily and builds trust in the platform.  

By identifying design properties in the mockup stage, the team creates a **visual language** that aligns both development and design, reducing confusion and ensuring a smoother workflow.
